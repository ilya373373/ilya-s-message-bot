welcome to my little program.
this is 1 of my first ever programs in .vbs.
how to use it?
you will have to open the .vbs file and from there you can set what you would like your message to be, you can do c t r l short cuts also so that the program can open a message box then type in it.
after that you need to put in how many times you would like the same message to be sent.
then you will put in the amount of sekunds you want the program to send your messages. then you will have to put in in how many sekunds you would like the program to run.
this will let you get to your edit box.
i hope you like this program.
you can find me on twitter at @teckvipserver and my website, i-v-studios.com
